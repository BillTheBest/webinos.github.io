In order to get a reference to the API, you will have to discover the API. You can use the dashboard to allow the user pick the service for you, but you can also do this manually in code (see the API description for the dashboard use).

##Service Discovery
This is the list of URIs used to declare this API's features, for use in the widget config.xml and as identifier for service type in service discovery functionality. For each URI, the list of functions covered is provided.

        webinos.discovery.findServices(new ServiceType('http://webinos.org/api/applauncher'), 
        {onFound: function (service) {
        //Stores the Service in a local variable
         foundService = service
         }

From this point we will refer to the found service as if it was stored in the foundService variable.

##Bind
Before using a service, you need to bind to it. Binding is similar on all services. The following code shows how to bind to the Applauncher API. Bind to the found and select a service and use. This is required to make calls possible on the webinos service that we created.

	 $('#bind').bind('click', function() {                        
                        appLauncherToUse = launcherAPIS[$('#pzh_pzp_list option:selected').val()];
                        appLauncherToUse.bind({onBind:function(){
                        $('#messages').append('<li> AppLauncher API ' + appLauncherToUse.api + ' bound.</li>');
                        }});
                    }); 

Define the launchApplication success callback.

		appLauncherToUse.launchApplication(
                                function (ok){
                                    if (ok) {
                            $('#messages').append('<li> App launched </li>');
                            } else {
                            $('#messages').append('<li> App NOT launched </li>');
                            }

Activate webinos application, if the application is installed in the device. appLauncherService is the AppLauncher service, discovered through the webinos Discovery API, that has been selected by the user

                 appLauncherToUse.appInstalled(
                         function (appFound){
                              if (appFound) {
                                    $('#messages').append('<li> App is installed </li>');
                            } else {
                                    $('#messages').append('<li> App NOT installed </li>');
                            }
                                },
                                function (){
                                    $('#messages').append('<li> Error while checking app installation</li>');                           
                                },
                                appID
                       );
