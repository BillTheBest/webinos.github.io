TODO: Update with device orientation examples.
Code Snippet

Whenever an event fires a significant change in orientation occurs. In addition, when a new listener registers for the event, implementations fire the event as soon as sufficiently fresh data is available.

    DeviceOrientationEvent = function(alpha, beta, gamma){
        this.initDeviceOrientationEvent(alpha, beta, gamma);
    }

Check if there are other listeners for a certain Event type. Find the relevant ObjectRefs and Remove it from the list of Listeners. 

    if(objectRefsDo[i][1] == params[1]){ 
        registeredListeners++;
    }
    if(objectRefsDo[i][0] == params[0]){ 
        objectRefsDo.splice(i,1);
        console.log('object# ' + params[0] + " removed (" +  params[1] + ")");
    }


The default action of event presents the user agents with details of how to calibrate the compass. The event is cancelable, so that web sites can provide their own alternative calibration UI.
- The property acceleration provides the acceleration of the hosting device relative to the Earth frame, expressed in the body frame.
- The property accelerationIncludingGravity provides an acceleration equal and opposite to the acceleration due to gravity. 
- The property rotationRate provides the rate of rotation of the hosting device in space. 
- The property interval provides the interval at which data is obtained from the underlying hardware and must be expressed in milliseconds and remains to be a constant. 

The device motion event has the following declaration:

    DeviceMotionEvent = function(acceleration, accelerationIncludingGravity, rotationRate, interval){
        this.initDeviceMotionEvent(acceleration, accelerationIncludingGravity, rotationRate, interval);
    }
