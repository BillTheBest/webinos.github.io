We have created a [test page](https://github.com/webinos/webinos-dashboard/blob/master/web/static/test.html) with a lot of different use cases of the dashboard API. Having installed the API you can visit the page in http://localhost:8080/dashboard/static/test.html.

## Usages

The following opens the enroll to the PZH screen:

    function openEnroll(){
        webinos.dashboard.open({module:'config'}, function(){console.log("***enrollment opened");});
    }

The following allows the user to select a single service between the test api and the applauncher api.

    webinos.dashboard.open({
        module:'explorer',
        data:{
            service:['http://webinos.org/api/test', 'http://webinos.org/api/applauncher']
            }
    }, function(){console.log("***Dashboard opened");}).onAction(function(data){console.log("User selected something");});

To see the above mentioned example in action, you can see the how the [POC Device orientation Application uses dashboard](https://github.com/webinos-apps/poc-DeviceOrientation/blob/master/src/resources/do.js#L14)
